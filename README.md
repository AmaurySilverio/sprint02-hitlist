# Hitlist - [arr]ange

## Keep all the companies on your hitlist organized with [arr]ange!

This is an application that lets you keep track of companies you are interested in applying for, similar to Huntr.

It is tailored to those looking for a job in tech, hence the pun in the name "[arr]ange"

Companies are saved in JSON Server. Users are able to add companies, delete companies, filter companies by priority, location, or name.

Error handling is implemented for PUT, POST and DELETE requests.

### Languages used:
